# BF591-final-project-RSshiny-app
Built an app to analyze genomics data: 
The repo hosts an RShiny application to enable a front-end user to visualize data in many ways. In the primary samples tab, the user can get a summary of specified data in sortable columns. Further, the counts data requires the user to upload a counts data which can be visualized through a volcano plot and generate interactive plot outputs by adjusting the threshold parameters for the following: p-value, log2fold change and % genes passing the filter. The deseq2 and WGCNA sections make it easier for the user to view differential expression analysis and correlation networks between certain genes. The video demonstration is efficient in providing a clear picture of all the details and specific data which can be easily visualized and interpreted using the application. The application is extremely convenient in making important decisions with respect to research and generating interactive plots results in better analyses of the data.
